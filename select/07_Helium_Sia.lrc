[00:25.83] I'm trying but I keep falling down
[00:32.73] I cry out but nothing comes now
[00:39.48] I'm giving my all and I know peace will come
[00:46.65] I never wanted to need someone
[01:01.65] 
[00:51.95] Yeah, I wanted to play tough
[00:53.97] Thought I could do all just on my own
[00:58.92] But even Superwoman
[01:00.61] Sometimes needed Superman's soul
[01:16.61] 
[01:05.81] Help me out of this hell
[01:07.84] Your love lifts me up like helium
[01:14.97] Your love lifts me up when I'm down down down
[01:21.62] When I've hit the ground
[01:23.42] You're all I need
[01:31.92] 
[01:28.53] And if you let go I'll float towards the sun
[01:35.71] I'm stronger 'cause you fill me up
[01:42.37] But when the fear comes and I drift towards the ground
[01:49.62] I am lucky that you're around
[02:04.12] 
[01:55.03] Yeah, I wanted to play tough
[01:57.03] Thought I could do all just on my own
[02:01.98] But even Superwoman
[02:03.75] Sometimes needed Superman's soul
[02:19.75] 
[02:08.79] Help me out of this hell
[02:10.74] Your love lifts me up like helium
[02:17.99] Your love lifts me up when I'm down down down
[02:24.67] When I've hit the ground
[02:26.48] You're all I need
[02:31.58] 'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
[02:38.90] Your love lifts me up like helium
[02:55.40] 
[02:45.33] You lift me up and I am found
[02:48.77] You lift me up before I hit the ground
[02:52.46] You lift me up when I'm down down down
[02:55.86] You lift me up before I hit the ground
[02:59.41] You lift me up and I am found
[03:02.74] You lift me up before I hit the ground
[03:06.42] You lift me up when I'm down down down
[03:09.87] You lift me up before I hit the ground!
[03:29.37] 
[03:14.01] Your love lifts me up like helium
[03:20.85] Your love lifts me up when I'm down down down
[03:27.78] When I've hit the ground
