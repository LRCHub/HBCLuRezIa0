I wanna love you, and I love you
But I shouldn't take your heart,
but I just couldn't
'Cause I wouldn't make you
feel it all
Oh, I'd just hurt you,
but I wouldn't ever mean to
Keep you 'round to look
right through you
Keep on pushing you until
you fall
It's not my fault
It's all I know
If I didn't want,
you wouldn't care at all
Oh, what to do? To do with you?
So,
how can I put this? Is
it getting through?
I wanna love you, and I love you
But I shouldn't take your heart,
but I just couldn't
'Cause I wouldn't make you
feel it all
Oh, I'd just hurt you,
but I wouldn't ever mean to
Keep you 'round to look
right through you
Keep on pushing you until
you fall
It's not my fault
It's all I know
If I didn't want,
you wouldn't care at all
Oh, what to do? To do with you?
So,
how can I put this? Is
it getting through?
I wanna love you, and I love you
But I shouldn't take your heart,
but I just couldn't
'Cause I wouldn't make you
feel it all
Oh, I'd just hurt you,
but I wouldn't ever mean to
Keep you 'round to look
right through you
Keep on pushing you until
you fall
It's not my fault
It's all I know
If I didn't want,
you wouldn't care at all
Oh, what to do? To do with you?
So,

it getting through?
I wanna love you, and I love you
But I shouldn't take your heart,
but I just couldn't
'Cause I wouldn't make you
feel it all
Oh, I'd just hurt you,
but I wouldn't ever mean to
Keep you 'round to look
right through you
Keep on pushing,
pushing 'til you fall
It's not my fault
It's all I know
If I didn't want,
you wouldn't care at all
Oh, what to do? To do with you?
So how can I put this? Is
it getting through?
I wanna love you, and I love you
But I shouldn't take your—
Oh, I'd just hurt you,
but I wouldn't ever mean to
Keep you—
I wanna love you, and I love you
But I shouldn't take your—
